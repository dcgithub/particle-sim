# Particle Motion
## The key framework for developing easy-to-use, scalable, user-friendly interfaces for particle motion and other simulations.
From a physicist to an epedimiologist to a molecular scientist (do people really study that suff?), the possibilities for why you'd want to use this framework are endless. But why isn't there a simple, easy-to-use framework for particle motion? Simulating real-world events is hard enough ... let's make it easier!
